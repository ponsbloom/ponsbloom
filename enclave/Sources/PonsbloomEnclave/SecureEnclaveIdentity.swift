/// SecureEnclaveIdentity — hardware-bound P-256 signing key management.
///
/// This class manages a P-256 ECDSA signing key stored in the Apple Secure
/// Enclave. The private key never leaves the hardware — only signing operations
/// can be performed through the CryptoKit API.
///
/// The Secure Enclave is available on all Apple Silicon Macs and provides:
///   - Hardware-isolated key storage (private key cannot be exported)
///   - Tamper-resistant signing operations
///   - Device-bound identity (key cannot be cloned to another device)
///
/// This identity serves two purposes in Ponsbloom:
///   1. **Attestation signing**: The provider signs a hardware/software state
///      blob with this key, proving its identity and security posture.
///   2. **Challenge-response**: The coordinator periodically challenges the
///      provider to sign a nonce, verifying the same hardware is still connected.
///
/// The public key is a raw P-256 point (64 bytes: X || Y, without the 0x04
/// uncompressed prefix). Both base64 and hex representations are available
/// for interoperability with the Go coordinator (which expects either format).
///
/// Persistence: The key's `dataRepresentation` is an opaque handle from the
/// Secure Enclave — NOT the raw private key. It can only be used to reload
/// the same key on the same device.
