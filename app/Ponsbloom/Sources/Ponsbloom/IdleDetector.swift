/// IdleDetector — Monitors user keyboard/mouse activity.
///
/// Ponsbloom should only serve inference when the user isn't actively using
/// their Mac. This class polls the system's idle time (seconds since last
/// keyboard/mouse event) on a 10-second interval and publishes whether
/// the user is idle.
///
/// The idle timeout is configurable (default 5 minutes). When the user
/// transitions between active and idle, StatusViewModel observes the
/// change and pauses/resumes the provider accordingly.
///
/// Implementation note:
///   Uses `CGEventSource.secondsSinceLastEventType(.hidSystemState, ...)`
///   which requires no special permissions (unlike accessibility APIs).
///   The `CGEventType(rawValue: ~0)!` value acts as a wildcard for any
///   input event type.
